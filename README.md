# hamburger-icon-animate
_Code by Christine Nyman_

This is a little bit of code to add an animation to the hamburger icon. The bulk of the animation is powered by CSS3 keyframes and raw JavaScript is used to control when each animation is run.

## Instructions
1. Copy html element '#hamburger' into your html code. Copy both the js files inside the script folder to your script folder. Copy the stylesheet code and insert into your own stylesheet. I would suggest keeping the css animations in a separate file inside your styles folder.
