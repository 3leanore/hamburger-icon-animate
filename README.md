# hamburger-icon-animate
_Code by Christine Nyman_

This is a little bit of code to add an animation to the hamburger icon. The bulk of the animation is powered by CSS3 keyframes and raw JavaScript is used to control when each animation is run.

## Instructions
It's pretty simple if you know what you're doing. It's just a matter of copy&pasting.

First, <a href="https://github.com/3leanore/hamburger-icon-animate/archive/master.zip" title="download the code">download</a> the repo. Copy the script and css folder contents into your css and script folders.

Copy the code inside main.css into your main css file. It purely contains the styling for the hamburger. You can edit the styling properties 'width', 'height' and 'background-color' but not 'position' and 'z-index'. Changing those properties could break the animation.

_Important: Keep animation.css as a separate file inside the same folder as your main stylesheet._

Link up the js files in script tags at the bottom of your html file.

Copy the html element '#hamburger' directly into your html file. Place it wherever necessary. Be careful not to change the id and class names.

Run to make sure it works. It should work on the latest browsers, except on Internet Explorer 8 and earlier.
